# Minishell - 42 Network Project (Collaboration with Hamza Benfaddoul)

## Introduction
Minishell is a collaborative project between you and Hamza Benfaddoul, and it is part of the 42 Network projects, an educational network of coding schools. The project aims to create a simple shell, providing a basic command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system. The shell supports various built-in commands and offers functionalities similar to standard Unix shells.

## Features
Minishell offers the following features:

1. **Command Execution:** Users can execute various commands available in the system, including both built-in commands and external programs.

2. **Built-in Commands:** Minishell supports several built-in commands, such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.

3. **Redirection and Pipes:** The shell supports input/output redirection and pipes, allowing users to connect commands in a pipeline.

4. **Signal Handling:** Minishell handles various signals such as Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT), providing a graceful termination of processes.

5. **Environment Variables:** Users can manipulate environment variables using the built-in commands `export` and `unset`.

6. **Error Handling:** The shell provides appropriate error messages and handles errors efficiently.

## How to Use
1. Clone the Minishell repository from the 42 Network:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Change into the Minishell directory:
   ```
   cd minishell
   ```

3. Build the Minishell executable using the provided build system:
   ```
   make
   ```

4. Run Minishell:
   ```
   ./minishell
   ```

5. Use the shell to execute commands, including built-in commands and external programs.

## Examples
1. Running a built-in command:
   ```
   minishell$ echo Hello, World!
   Hello, World!
   ```

2. Executing an external program:
   ```
   minishell$ ls -l
   total 123
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user group   543 Jul 25 10:00 file.txt
   drwxr-xr-x 2 user group  4096 Jul 25 09:59 directory
   ...
   ```

3. Using environment variables:
   ```
   minishell$ export MY_VAR=42
   minishell$ echo $MY_VAR
   42
   ```

## Supported Platforms
Minishell is designed to run on Unix-based systems, such as Linux and macOS.
